			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<div id="case01">
				<h2>Metal Center Acos e Metais Ltda</h2>
				<p>In 1997, with the installation of a cutting-edge technology park. This strategic investment was the
					pillar for the development and continued implementation of an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
					system, which became the backbone of our operations and remains in full use to this day, a testament
					to its resilience and adaptability to the needs of the company, which demonstrates the impact of my
					technological solutions.

				<h2>CEJA</h2>
				<p>In 2005, I designed and implemented a student management system for public schools in Rio de Janeiro.
					This innovative initiative resulted in a reduction of over 90% in the use of paper and the need for
					physical archiving, significantly optimizing processes. The system made school management
					significantly more efficient, providing real-time information and safely impacting the educational
					administration of the public network.
				</p>

			<div id="case03">
				<h2>Rubber Group</h2>
				<p>In 2010, I led the strategic upgrade of Metal Center’s ERP system, expanding its capabilities to
					integrate the Rubber Group, which comprises the companies MRX Rodas e Rodízios, MRX Industrial,
					Metal Rubber and MRubber. This crucial initiative resulted in the complete unification of financial
					and inventory data from all companies in the group, streamlining management and ensuring a holistic
					view of operations.

				<h2>PDV Control</h2>
				<p>In 2017, I accepted a new professional challenge when I was hired by PDV Control. My role was to

			<h2>Transferable Skills</h2>
			<p>As I am very old in IT, I gained skills that only time brings, such as: knowing your client and
				feeling their problems, seeking a relationship with everyone involved in a project to have real
				feedback on what is happening, not having a problem with assume my mistakes and seek the
				solution,
				work under pressure, guide the youngest and engage them in the team.
				But the skill I most appreciate in myself and others and is open to learning new things.
