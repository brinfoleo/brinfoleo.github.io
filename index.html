			<h2>History and Experience</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>In 1993 I passed a competition to work at <a href="http://bb.com.br" target="_blank">Banco do
							Brasil
							S/A. </a>, where I had my first contact with computers and was fascinated with what MS-DOS,
						Lotus
						123 and Word Star could do</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In 1997 I worked at a company <a href="http://www.metalcentermetais.com.br" target="_blank">Metal
							Center</a>, that I supported and implemented new features in a company management
						system written in Turbo Mumps.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In 2002 I rewrote the system in Turbo Mumps in Visual Basic 6 using the MS-Access database and
						implemented the company's network, giving support to the system and maintaining the hardware.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In 2005 I wrote a school management system for <a
							href="https://www.cecierj.edu.br/rede-ceja/escolas/" target="_blank">CEJA</a> a public
						school
						for youth and adults in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Also this year I started my own company
						focused on supplying hardware to the government by bidding.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In 2010 I had to go deeper into the legislation for trade in goods to develop a new business
						management
						system that would include the new government rules, with that I did some work in companies
						focused on
						the issuance of <a href="http://www.nfe.fazenda.gov.br/portal/principal.aspx" target="_blank">
							NFe and NFCe.</a></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In 2017 I wrote a POS system in VB.Net with a SQLite database and participated in the update
						(focusing
						on tax legislation) of the legacy system of the company <a href="http://www.pdvcontrol.com.br"
							target="_blank"> PDV Control.</a></p>
				</li>

				<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
				<p>Despite not having worked with some of these technologies, I had the opportunity to learn: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Java</li>
					<li>C#</li>
					<li>MySQL</li>
					<li>VB6</li>
					<li>VB.Net</li>
					<li>Network</li>
					<li>Computer maintenance</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="row">
				<h2>Transferable skills</h2>
				<p>As I am very old in IT, I gained skills that only time brings, such as: knowing your client and
					feeling their problems, seeking a relationship with everyone involved in a project to have real
					feedback on what is happening, not having a problem with assume my mistakes and seek the solution,
					work under pressure, guide the youngest and engage them in the team.
					But the skill I most appreciate in myself and others and is open to learning new things.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<h2>Return to Tech</h2>
				<blockquote>As seen above, technology has always been my life, and although it is not entirely out
					of the business, as I still support the systems I have developed, I want to evolve, grow, learn
					about new technologies, new mindsets, new cultures and experiences. So I decided to change
					parents, with that I learned new professions, new cultures, new languages, and now I believe I
					am ready for the next step and return to work in technology in this new scenario.</blockquote>
